My name is Piotr Rusin. I majored in civil engineering at Poznan University of Technology, but I&#8217;m more interested in programming, both as a hobby and as a career choice.

On this blog, I&#8217;m going to describe my projects, ideas and progress I&#8217;m making in learning programming and computer science.

I chose the name &#8220;Reusing the wheel&#8221; as a reference to two approaches to software development: doing something from scratch (&#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221;) and reusing existing code. The first is generally discouraged &#8211; especially for developing commercial software, although it can be fun and useful as a learning experience when developing personal projects. The second is a common good practice, saving time and effort and allowing a programmer to focus on solving project-specific problems.

I hope the blog will be interesting to read. Any comments and suggestions are welcome &#8211; I&#8217;m always open to learn something new or improve my knowledge. You can post your comment on the blog or send me an email to <piotr.rusin88@gmail.com>.
